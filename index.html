                <h2>About Naawi-Oodena</h2>
               <p>Naawi-Oodena is a special project led by Treaty One Nations and Canada Lands Company. The land was once a military base called Kapyong Barracks. Now, it will become a new place for homes, parks, and culture. 
                The name means "heart of the community" in the Anishinaabe language.</p> <p>The area is 160 acres. Treaty One owns most of it. This is a big win for Indigenous people. The plan includes trails, gathering spots, and places to play.
                Streets and art will show Indigenous culture and languages. It mixes modern city ideas with First Nations traditions.</p>
